This contains all the important data-structure and algorithm libraries not provided by STL. There are two versions for each library, one extended with possibly all the funtionality ever required and second a short version of same implementation for faster implementation during coding competitions.

Content:
1. Two versions of union find data structure
2. Segment tree (extended version)
3. next_permutation generator
4. String matching algorithms(KMP and RK)
5. Heaps

TO-DO LIST
1. Treap
2. KD tree
