/*The motivation of creating this file is to touch every possible algorithm used in solving
    problems that appear frequently in coding challanges and algorithm includes are not allowed.
    The main aim is to prepare a exhaustive yet important implementation of algorithm in short way
    such that re implementing such algorithm during challege environment dont take too much time.*/
