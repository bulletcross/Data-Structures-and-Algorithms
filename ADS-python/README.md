## Graph Data Structure and algorithms
For graph problems, atleast APIs that is required to be implemented are `addVertex`, `addEdge` and `getVertex`.

Representations: `adjencyList` and `adjencyMatrix`

Algorithms: `bfs`, `dfs`, `topological sorting`, `shortest path`, `connectivity` and `maximum flow`.
